- Download the project zip file and add the project to your Unity Editor with the 'add project from disk' option in the Unity Editor.

- Download Unity 2023.1.20f1 version and open the project with this version.

- Since the WebGL package is installed in the project, you need to download these packages from your editor while the project is loading. If you do not download them, a pop-up may appear.

- After the project is opened, you will need to install the missing package assets and add them to the project. These are: Netcode For Gameobjects, Relay.

- Apart from these packages, there is also a separate asset list for the models. I will state this list below.
